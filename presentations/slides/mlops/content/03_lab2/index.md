# CloudML Lab 2
## Overview

This lab provides an introductory, end-to-end walkthrough of training and prediction on Cloud Machine Learning Engine. You will walk through a sample that uses a census dataset to:

* Create a TensorFlow training application and validate it locally.

* Run your training job on a single worker instance in the cloud.

* Run your training job as a distributed training job in the cloud.

* Optimize your hyperparameters by using hyperparameter tuning.

* Deploy a model to support prediction.

* Request an online prediction and see the response.
