# GANs
## Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

* One of the most promising recent developments in Deep Learning

* Attacks the problem of unsupervised learning by training two deep networks, that compete and cooperate with each other. In the course of training, both networks eventually learn how to perform their tasks.

* GAN is almost always explained like the case of a counterfeiter (Generative) and the police (Discriminator)


## Discriminator
A discriminator that tells how real an image is, is basically a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Generator
The generator synthesizes fake images

## Example
The GAN is learning how to write handwritten digits on its own!
