# Using Existing Models 
## Applications

Keras Applications are deep learning models that are made available alongside pre-trained weights. These models can be used for prediction, feature extraction, and fine-tuning. Weights are downloaded automatically when instantiating a model. 

Available models for image classification with weights trained on ImageNet:

* Xception
* VGG16
* VGG19
* ResNet50
* InceptionV3
* InceptionResNetV2
* MobileNet
* DenseNet
* NASNet
* MobileNetV2
