# Deeper into Neural Nets 


# CNN: What Are they Used For?
* Images that you want to find features in
* Machine Translations
* Sentiment Analysis


## They can find features that are not in a specific spot
* Like a stop sign in a picture
* Or words within a sentence


# Convolutional Neural Networks

* Convolutional neural networks are deep artificial neural networks that are used primarily to classify images (e.g. name what they see), cluster them by similarity (photo search), and perform object recognition within scenes. 

* They are algorithms that can identify faces, individuals, street signs, tumors, platypuses and many other aspects of visual data.
