# Lab 6: Deploy trained model

### **Step 1**

Go back to the listing page in Datalab and navigate to **training-data-analyst/courses/machine_learning/deepdive/06_structured/** and click on **6_deploy.ipynb**

### **Step 2**

**Clear** all the cells in the notebook, **change** the project and bucket settings in the first cell, and then **Run** the cells one by one.

### **Summary**

## Lab 7: Run client applications

In this step, you learned to deploy a trained model as a microservice and get it to do both online and batch prediction.

### **Step 1**

Open **CloudShell**, and git clone the repository if necessary:
    
    
    git clone 
        https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst/

### **Step 2**

In **CloudShell**, deploy the website application:
    
    
    cd training-data-analyst/courses/machine_learning/deepdive
    cd 06_structured/serving
    ./deploy.sh

### **Step 3**

In a **browser**, visit https://.appspot.com/ and try out the application.

### **Step 4**

In **CloudShell**, call a Java program that invokes the web service:
    
    
    cd ~/training-data-analyst/courses/machine_learning/deepdive
    cd 06_structured/serving
    ./run_once.sh

### **Step 5**

In **CloudShell**, call a Dataflow pipeline that invokes the web service on a text file:
    
    
    cd ~/training-data-analyst/courses/machine_learning/deepdive
    cd 06_structured/serving
    ./run_ontext.sh

The code will also work real-time, reading from Pub/Sub and writing to BigQuery:
    
    
    cd ~/training-data-analyst/courses/machine_learning/deepdive
    cd 06_structured/serving
    cat ./run_dataflow.sh

### **Summary**

In this step, you deployed an AppEngine web application that consumes the machine learning service. You also looked at how to consume the ML predictions from Dataflow, both in batch mode and in real-time.
