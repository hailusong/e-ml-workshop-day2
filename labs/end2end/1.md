# Lab 1: Explore data

This lab illustrates how you can carry out data exploration of large datasets, but continue to use familiar tools like Pandas and Jupyter. The "trick" is to do the first part of your aggregation in BigQuery, get back a Pandas dataset and then work with the smaller Pandas dataset locally. Cloud Datalab provides a managed Jupyter experience, so that you don't need to run notebook servers yourself.

### **Launch Cloud Datalab**

To launch Cloud Datalab:

### **Step 1**

Open Cloud Shell. The cloud shell icon is at the top right of the Google Cloud Platform [web console][2]:

![][3]

### **Step 2**

In Cloud Shell, type:
    
    
    gcloud compute zones list

Pick a zone in a geographical region close to you.

### **Step 3**

In Cloud Shell, type:
    
    
    datalab create babyweight --zone 

substituting the zone you chose in Step 2 for "". Datalab will take about 5 minutes to start. **Move on to the next step while it continues working to setup your Jupyter server**.

## **Invoke BigQuery**

You will now use BigQuery, a serverless data warehouse, to explore the natality dataset so that we can choose the features for our machine learning model.

To invoke a BigQuery query:

### **Step 1**

Navigate to the BigQuery console by selecting BigQuery from the top-left-corner ("hamburger") menu.

### **Step 2**

In the BigQuery Console, click on **Compose Query**.

### **Step 3**

In the query textbox, type:
    
    
    #standardsql
    SELECT
      plurality,
      COUNT(1) AS num_babies,
      AVG(weight_pounds) AS avg_wt
    FROM
      publicdata.samples.natality
    WHERE
      year > 2000 AND year < 2005
    GROUP BY
      plurality

How many triplets were born in the US between 2000 and 2005? ___________

## **Draw graphs in Cloud Datalab**

Switch back to your Cloud Shell window. 

### **Step 1**

If necessary, wait for Datalab to finish launching. Datalab is ready when you see a message prompting you to do a "Web Preview".

### **Step 2**

Click on the **Web Preview** icon on the top-right corner of the Cloud Shell ribbon. Switch to port **8081**.

### **Step 3**

In Datalab, start a new notebook by clicking on the **+Notebook** icon.

### **Step 4**

In a cell in Datalab, type the following, then click **Run** and wait until you see a table of data**.**
    
    
    query="""
    SELECT
      weight_pounds,
      is_male,
      mother_age,
      plurality,
      gestation_weeks
    FROM
      publicdata.samples.natality
    WHERE year > 2000
    """
    import google.datalab.bigquery as bq
    df = bq.Query(query + " LIMIT 100").execute().result().to_dataframe()
    df.head()

Note that we have gotten the results from BigQuery as a Pandas dataframe.

### **Step 5**

In the next cell in Datalab, type the following, then click **Run**
    
    
    def get_distinct_values(column_name):
      sql = """
    SELECT
      {0},
      COUNT(1) AS num_babies,
      AVG(weight_pounds) AS avg_wt
    FROM
      publicdata.samples.natality
    WHERE
      year > 2000
    GROUP BY
      {0}
      """.format(column_name)
      return bq.Query(sql).execute().result().to_dataframe()
    
    df = get_distinct_values('is_male')
    df.plot(x='is_male', y='avg_wt', kind='bar');

Are male babies heavier or lighter than female babies? Did you know this? _______

Is the sex of the baby a good feature to use in our machine learning model? _____

### **Step 6**

In the next cell in Datalab, type the following, then click **Run**
    
    
    df = get_distinct_values('gestation_weeks')
    df = df.sort_values('gestation_weeks')
    df.plot(x='gestation_weeks', y='avg_wt', kind='bar');

This graph shows the average weight of babies born in the each week of pregancy. The way you'd read the graph is to look at the y-value for x=35 to find out the average weight of a baby born in the 35th week of pregnancy. 

Is `gestation_weeks` a good feature to use in our machine learning model? _____

Is `gestation_weeks` always available? __________

Compare the variability of birth weight due to sex of baby and due to gestation weeks. Which factor do you think is more important for accurate weight prediction? __________________________________

## **Summary**

In this step, you learned how to carry out data exploration of large datasets using BigQuery, Pandas, and Jupyter. The "trick" is to do the first part of your aggregation in BigQuery, get back a Pandas dataset and then work with the smaller Pandas dataset locally. Cloud Datalab provides a managed Jupyter experience, so that you don't need to run notebook servers yourself.
