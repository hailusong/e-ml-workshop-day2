# Lab 3: Create Tensorflow Wide-and-Deep model

### **Step 1**

Go back to the listing page in Datalab and navigate to **training-data-analyst/courses/machine_learning/deepdive/06_structured/** and click on **3_tensorflow.ipynb**

### **Step 2**

**Clear** all the cells in the notebook, **change** the project and bucket settings in the first cell, and then **Run** the cells one by one.

### **Summary**

In this step, you learned how to develop Tensorflow models in Datalab on a small sampled dataset.
