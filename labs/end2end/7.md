# Lab 7: Run client applications

In this step, you learned to deploy a trained model as a microservice and get it to do both online and batch prediction.

### **Step 1**

Open **CloudShell**, and git clone the repository if necessary:
    
    
    git clone 
        git clone https://github.com/ArctiqTeam/e-ml-workshop-day2

### **Step 2**

In **CloudShell**, deploy the website application:
    
    pip install Flask==0.12.1 google-api-python-client==1.6.2 --user


### **Step 3**

In **CloudShell**, deploy the website application:
    
    pip install Flask==0.12.1 google-api-python-client==1.6.2 --user
    
    cd e-ml-workshop-day2/serving/

    chmod +x main.py

    gcloud config set project  <project_id>

    MODEL_NAME=babyweight

    VERSION_NAME=ml_on_gcp

    PROJECT=<project_id>

    ./main.py

### **Step 4**

In **CloudShell**, deploy the website application:

    Change Port to 5000 and Preview
    
### **Step 5**

In **CloudShell**, deploy the website application:

    Authenticate If Required
    Test Applicateion 
    Did You Get A Prediction?

### **Summary**

In this step, you deployed an python web application that consumes the machine learning service.
